<!-- Challenge 1

First  I decided to create a prompt dialog box so that the user can  input the raw marks.

Then I proceeded to use the parseFloat so that the it makes sure the marks input will appear as an integer whilst being executed.

I created a grading system next.




Challenge 2

The code will first prompt the user for the car's speed.

Convert the input to a floating-point number using parseFloat.

Then it will check if the speed is within the limit. If so, return "Ok."

If the speed exceeds the limit, calculate demerit points and check if they are below the limit. If so, return the demerit points.

If the demerit points exceed the limit, return "License Suspended." -->
